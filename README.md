# comp-prog-algorithms

This site is deployed at: [https://jeremyle56.github.io/comp-prog-algos/](https://jeremyle56.github.io/comp-prog-algos/).

The purpose of this website is to provide easy access to reference (with simple copy and paste) while training or solving competitive programming problems with common data structures and algorithms.

This was built with the challenge of not installing any dependencies (which includes frontend frameworks) and utilises Bootstrap along with raw HTML/CSS/JS.
